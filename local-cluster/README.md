# Setting up Kubernetes Cluster

## Local Virtual Machine

  - VirtualBox
  - Ubuntu 16 or later iso image

- Open the VirtualBox and setup a new virtual machine with the above ubuntu ISO image. To check
  whether VM has been installed correctly or not, try to do SSH into it. It might fail to ssh, Due to
  SSH server is not installed into VM. So you please make sure that open-ssh is installed into the VM
  and then try ssh-ing

- If you reach this point means, you successfully setup a virtual machine. Congradulations for that.
